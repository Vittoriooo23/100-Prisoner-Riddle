# 100-Prisoner-Riddle
Solves and proves Peter Bro Miltersen's mathematical strategy to the 100 Prisoner Puzzle.


Inspired by Veritasium video "The Riddle That Seems Impossible Even If You Know The Answer", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA&t=297s

Simple code with no GUI, works with console. In main, you can adjust the numbers to your delight, changing the number of prisoners as well as the number of trials.

note: for random selection, the predicted statistic is 0.0000000000000000000000000000008% so in order to even see a percentage that is not 0, you would need an incredible amount of trials which in turn would take an incredible amount of time. I believe this is as efficient as possible but feel free to improve if possible!
